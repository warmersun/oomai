# oom.ai: The Knowledge Graph for Emerging Tech Foresight

## Overview
**oom.ai** is a **Reasoning Engine** that couples the conversational fluency of advanced AI (Grok-4-Fast) with the rigorous, structured memory of a **Knowledge Graph**.

It is designed for one specific purpose: **Deep Tech Foresight.** It helps you understand not just *what* is happening in technology, but *what it means, what it connects to, and where it is going.*

## License & Pricing

**oom.ai** is built for sovereignty. You run it yourself, on your own hardware, with your own data.

- The **entire tool** is **free forever** under the **MIT License**.
- This means anyone can use it for **personal or commercial purposes** (client work, consulting, internal enterprise use, etc.) without ever paying anything.

**Pro Lifetime License** ($499–$999 one-time) is completely optional.  
It is **not required** for commercial use.

You buy Pro only if you want:
- Priority support from the creator (usually same-day replies)
- One private 1-hour onboarding call to help set up your graph and first bets
- A signed official license document for your company or legal records
- Access to the private Pro-only Discord community
- To directly support continued development

The software, commands, and capabilities are **identical** in both versions.

This is the same honest, transparent model used by many respected self-hosted tools in 2026.

## The Core Value Proposition
### 1. Context-First Research
Generic AI tools like Perplexity or ChatGPT are excellent researchers. They can scour the web and synthesize vast amounts of information in seconds. However, they lack **your** context. They don't know which thought leaders you trust, which strategic bets you've placed, or what your internal assessments are.

**oom.ai is different because it injects YOUR context *before* it starts researching.**
*   **The Problem**: A generic AI researches in a vacuum. It returns a "general consensus" answer.
*   **The Solution**: oom.ai first looks up **your** Knowledge Graph. It retrieves your specific bets, the experts you follow (e.g., "What does Yann LeCun say about this?"), and your previous assessments.
*   **The Result**: It conducts the same deep research as a generic AI, but it filters and interprets the findings through the lens of **your** strategy. It doesn't just tell you what happened; it tells you **how it affects your specific positions.**

### 2. Strategic Foresight is a Fiduciary Duty
Emerging technologies are not merely "interesting trends"; they are **productivity multipliers**. When a technology becomes **100x cheaper and 10x faster**, corporate leaders face a legal and ethical obligation to adapt.
*   **The Risk**: Ignoring a 100x efficiency gain is not a "strategic choice"; it is negligence. Shareholders demand profit maximization.
*   **The Consequence**: Executives who fail to integrate these multipliers risk being outcompeted, fired, or even sued for breaching their fiduciary duties.
*   **The Role of oom.ai**: It provides the *evidence* required to justify these pivots before it is too late.

### 3. Systematic Tracking of *All* Emerging Technologies
Most analysts—and most AIs—focus on the "current thing" (usually AI). oom.ai is built to track the **entire landscape** of Emerging Technologies (EmTech) simultaneously.
*   It monitors 14+ distinct domains: **AI, Robotics, Synthetic Biology, Quantum Computing, Nuclear Fusion, Space Tech, Neurotech, etc.**
*   **Why this matters**: The biggest breakthroughs happen at the intersections (Convergence). You cannot understand the future of "Robotics" without tracking "Battery Density" and "LLM Reasoning." oom.ai explicitly maps these cross-domain dependencies.

### 4. Turning Predictions into Data
In the tech world, "expert predictions" are usually treated as disposable content. oom.ai treats them as **Data**.
*   **The "Bet" Node**: The system structures every prediction as a "Bet" node.
*   **Accountability**: It tracks the thesis, the required milestones, and the deadline.
*   **Validation**: It continuously checks new events against old bets to see who was right and who was wrong.

## Why Use oom.ai Instead of ChatGPT/Perplexity?

| Feature | Generic AI (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Grok) | oom.ai (The Knowledge Graph App) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trend Spotting** | **Summarizes Opinions**: Reads articles to find what *others* think is trending. | **Derives Trends**: Tracks raw data (Capabilities & Milestones) to see *trends emerge* from the bottom up. |
| **Use Case Discovery** | **Ad-hoc**: Hard to find diverse, specific applications in a single search. | **Cumulative**: Systematically collects use cases daily, answering "What can we do *now* that we couldn't do before?" |
| **Predictions** | **Untracked**: Generates plausible text but doesn't "remember" past predictions. | **Accountable**: Tracks specific "Bets," who made them, and whether they are winning or losing. |
| **Data Nature** | **Snapshot**: "What does the web say today?" | **Longitudinal**: "How has this Capability progressed over the last 3 years?" |
| **Control** | **Centralized**: You are one of millions of users. | **Sovereign**: You control the sources and the axioms. |

## Powerful Analytical Commands
oom.ai includes a suite of specialized commands designed for high-level analysis, strategy, and fact-checking.

### Exploration & Analysis
*   **`Trend`**: Identifies, projects, **saves, and tracks** the trajectory of a specific capability (e.g., "Cost of Orbit") against real-world progress.
*   **`Map`**: Maps "Ideas" and "Predictions" to observed "Trends" and "Milestones" to see if reality is aligning with the theory.
*   **`Tool`**: Finds the specific "Stack" (Products, Services, Models) available to solve a problem *right now*.
*   **`Pathway`**: Generates a solution to a global problem (e.g., "Water Scarcity") using a convergence of at least 9 different EmTech domains.
*   **`Analyze`**: Answers the "So What?" behind breaking news. It dissects the strategic motivations of the parties involved, identifies who predicted it, and forecasts what it signals for the future.

### Validation & Accountability
*   **`Check`**: Instantly validates a specific prediction against the known facts in the graph.
*   **`Validate`**: A rigorous due-diligence agent that investigates a specific "Bet," searching for validating or invalidating signals in real-time.
*   **`Stale`**: Hunts for "Stale Bets"—predictions made >6 months ago that haven't been reviewed—and checks if their underlying assumptions still hold.
*   **`Contradict`**: Explicitly searches for **Tensions** and **Contradictions** in the graph (e.g., "Expert A says X will happen, but Expert B says X is physically impossible").

### Strategy & Gap Analysis
*   **`Strategy`**: Acts as a tiered consultant. You give it a URL, and it generates a "McKinsey-style" AI adoption strategy for that specific company, identifying low-hanging fruit and long-term transformation.
*   **`Gaps`**: Performs a "Negative Space" analysis. It tells you what is *missing* from the graph—blind spots where we have no bets, no data, or no established position.

### Data Ingestion
*   **`Book` / `Articles` / `Link`**: Tools for Admins to rapidly ingest messy unstructured text and convert it into clean, structured nodes in the graph.

---

## Competing with the Giants (Gartner, Forrester)
oom.ai allows individuals and boutique firms to compete with massive research consultancies.

*   **Speed**: Gartner reports take months to write. oom.ai updates its mental model in seconds.
*   **Cost**: Forrester charges tens of thousands for access. oom.ai can run on your laptop or a small cloud instance.
*   **Actionability**: Traditional reports give you a PDF. oom.ai gives you an **interactive database** that you can query, challenge, and extend.

---

## Who is this for?

### 1. Investors (VCs & Angels)
*   **Problem**: "Is this startup's roadmap physically possible, or just hype?"
*   **Solution**: Use `Validate` and `Check` to benchmark their claims against the known state-of-the-art in the graph.

### 2. Corporate Strategists & Founders
*   **Problem**: "How do I integrate AI without getting distracted by the noise?"
*   **Solution**: Use `Strategy` to get a customized, immediate roadmap for your specific business domain.

### 3. Researchers & Synthesis Engines
*   **Problem**: "I can't read 500 papers a week."
*   **Solution**: oom.ai ingests the high-signal sources for you. You use `Map` and `Trend` to see the forest, not just the trees.

### 4. Sovereignty-Minded Analysts
*   **Problem**: "I don't want OpenAI to define my worldview."
*   **Solution**: **Run your own instance.** You control the sources (`batch_sources.yaml`). You control the axioms. You build a "Second Brain" that actually belongs to you.

## Summary
**oom.ai** is a tool for **thinking clearly about the future**.

It moves beyond the "Chatbot" paradigm and into the "Research Partner" paradigm. By anchoring AI reasoning in a structured, observable reality, it provides a defense against hallucination and a telescope for identifying the non-obvious convergences that will shape the next decade.

# How to Use the Knowledge Graph App

oom.ai, the Knowledge Graph App is an AI-powered chatbot that helps you explore and analyze emerging technologies like AI, robotics, and quantum computing. It goes beyond general AI chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT) by using a structured backend to provide precise, evidence-based answers on tech trends, relationships, capabilities, milestones, and future predictions. This makes it ideal for deep, relational queries where accuracy and connections matter more than generic responses.

Access the deployed app online via [https://www.warmersun.com](https://www.warmersun.com) (which redirects to oom.ai) or its associated interface.

## Authentication

Log in with your assigned credentials.

Admins can modify content; general users focus on exploration.

## Selecting a Chat Profile

Start a chat and choose:
- **Read-Only**: For all users. Query and analyze without changes.
- **Read/Edit**: For admins only. Query, analyze, and update information.

This sets the mode for your session.

## Settings

In the sidebar:
- **Model**: Select `gpt-5` for detailed tasks or `gpt-5-mini` for speed.
- **Reasoning Effort**: Choose `low`, `medium`, or `high` for response depth (higher = more accurate but slower).

Update anytime during the chat.

## Interacting with the App

It's a simple conversational interface:
1. **Type Your Query**: Use natural language, e.g., "What are recent AI milestones in robotics?"
   - The app thinks (shows "Thinking...") and responds with insights.
2. **Responses**: Stream in real-time, often including reasoning or summaries.
3. **Context**: Conversations build on previous messages.
4. **End Session**: Just close it; everything resets cleanly.

## Commands

In Read/Edit mode, use shortcut buttons (icons) for common tasks:
- These prefix your message with a template for efficiency.
- Examples (based on app setup):
  - **Explore Convergence**: Click the icon, add "battery tech", and send—it turns into "Explore convergences in battery technology."
- Customize if you have admin access, but they're ready-to-use for quick starts.

## Text-to-Speech (TTS)

After a response:
- Click the "Read out loud" button (play icon) to hear it spoken.
- Audio plays automatically, with cleaned-up text for smooth listening.

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Query Effectively**: Be specific with dates, entities, or relationships for best results.
- **Performance**: Use high reasoning for complex predictions; mini model for quick facts.
- **Limitations**: Focuses on emerging tech; not for unrelated topics.
- **Security**: Admins, edit carefully to maintain accuracy.

## Use Cases: Why Better Than General AI Chatbots

This app shines where structured data and relationships are key, reducing hallucinations and providing traceable insights. Unlike ChatGPT (which relies on general knowledge and can invent details), it queries a curated, updatable graph for precise answers. Here are scenarios it's uniquely suited for:

- **Relational Queries**: "How does AI enable new capabilities in robotics?" → Gets exact connections and milestones, not vague overviews.
- **Temporal Trends**: "Track AI progress in gene sequencing since 2023." → Pulls dated milestones and predicts trends based on patterns.
- **Predictive Analysis**: "What might quantum computing look like by 2030?" → Simulates futures using convergences and data, with web/X searches for real-time validation.
- **Convergence Exploration**: "Find similar tech merges to drone + IoT." → Uncovers hidden links across technologies.
- **Editing and Curation (Admins)**: "Add a 2025 milestone for Boston Dynamics." → Updates the knowledge base directly, keeping it current—something chatbots can't do.
- **Complex Tasks**: "Plan steps to forecast battery tech scarcities turning to abundances." → Breaks down into tasks, searches external sources, and synthesizes—more structured than a single LLM response.

In short, it's for deep tech foresight where you need verifiable, interconnected info over casual chit-chat.

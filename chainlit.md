# How to Use the Knowledge Graph App

oom.ai, the Knowledge Graph App is an AI-powered chatbot that helps you explore and analyze emerging technologies like AI, robotics, and quantum computing. It goes beyond general AI chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT) by using a structured backend to provide precise, evidence-based answers on tech trends, relationships, capabilities, milestones, and future predictions. This makes it ideal for deep, relational queries where accuracy and connections matter more than generic responses.

Access the deployed app online via [https://www.warmersun.com](https://www.warmersun.com) (which redirects to oom.ai) or its associated interface.

## Authentication

Log in with your assigned credentials.

Admins can modify content; general users focus on exploration.

## Selecting a Chat Profile

Start a chat and choose:
- **Read-Only**: For all users. Query and analyze without changes.
- **Read/Edit**: For admins only. Query, analyze, and update information.

This sets the mode for your session.

## Model Configuration

The app now uses **Grok-4-Fast** as the primary AI model, providing fast and accurate responses for all queries. The model is optimized for both speed and quality, making it ideal for real-time exploration and analysis of the knowledge graph.

## Interacting with the App

It's a simple conversational interface:
1. **Type Your Query**: Use natural language, e.g., "What are recent AI milestones in robotics?"
   - The app thinks (shows "Thinking...") and responds with insights.
2. **Responses**: Stream in real-time, often including reasoning or summaries.
3. **Context**: Conversations build on previous messages.
4. **End Session**: Just close it; everything resets cleanly.

## Commands

The app includes several built-in commands to help you interact more efficiently. These commands are defined in the system and can be accessed through shortcut buttons in the interface:

### Available Commands:

#### **Book** (Edit mode only)
- **Icon**: 📖
- **Description**: "Capture ideas from a book summary"
- **Usage**: Click the book icon and paste your book summary to extract and relate ideas to the knowledge graph

#### **Articles** (Edit mode only)
- **Icon**: 📰
- **Description**: "Capture ideas from article"
- **Usage**: Click the newspaper icon and paste article content to extract and relate ideas to the knowledge graph

#### **Link** (Edit mode only)
- **Icon**: 🔗
- **Description**: "Capture ideas from URL"
- **Usage**: Click the link icon and provide a URL to visit, process, and extract information into the knowledge graph

#### **Trend** (Both modes)
- **Icon**: 📈
- **Description**: "Spot a trend related to..."
- **Usage**: Click the trending-up icon and specify a topic to identify trends, capabilities, and milestones over time

#### **Check** (Both modes)
- **Icon**: ✅
- **Description**: "Check if the prediction is valid"
- **Usage**: Click the check icon and provide a prediction to validate against the knowledge graph data

#### **Map** (Both modes)
- **Icon**: 🗺️
- **Description**: "Map ideas, and predictions to..."
- **Usage**: Click the map icon to find and map related ideas, trends, and predictions with their timelines and applications

#### **Tool** (Both modes)
- **Icon**: 🔧
- **Description**: "Find toolset for"
- **Usage**: Click the wrench icon to find the complete toolset (LAC, PAC, capabilities, LTC, PTC, EmTech) for a given topic

### Using Commands:
- Commands automatically format your input for optimal processing
- Edit-only commands (Book, Articles, Link) require admin access
- All commands can be used with natural language input
- Examples:
  - Click "Trend" and add "AI robotics" → analyzes AI robotics trends and milestones
  - Use "Map" with "quantum computing" → maps quantum computing ideas and predictions
  - Click "Check" with "battery breakthrough prediction" → validates the prediction against existing data

## Live Search

The app includes live search capabilities that can be enabled when needed:
- **Status**: Live search is available but **disabled by default** to optimize performance
- **Activation**: Can be toggled on for real-time data updates during your session
- **Use Case**: Enable when you need the most current information from external sources
- **Performance**: When enabled, responses may take slightly longer but include the latest data

## Text-to-Speech (TTS)

After receiving a response:
- Click the "Read out loud" button (play icon) to hear the response spoken
- Audio plays automatically with cleaned-up text for smooth listening
- Useful for long responses or when you prefer audio consumption
- Can be toggled on/off as needed

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Query Effectively**: Be specific with dates, entities, or relationships for best results
- **Use Commands**: Leverage built-in commands for common tasks to get better structured responses
- **Live Search**: Enable only when you need real-time data; keep disabled for faster general queries
- **TTS**: Use text-to-speech for long responses or when multitasking
- **Limitations**: Focuses on emerging tech; not for unrelated topics
- **Security**: Admins, edit carefully to maintain accuracy

## Use Cases: Why Better Than General AI Chatbots

This app shines where structured data and relationships are key, reducing hallucinations and providing traceable insights. Unlike ChatGPT (which relies on general knowledge and can invent details), it queries a curated, updatable graph for precise answers. Here are scenarios it's uniquely suited for:

- **Relational Queries**: "How does AI enable new capabilities in robotics?" → Gets exact connections and milestones, not vague overviews
- **Temporal Trends**: "Track AI progress in gene sequencing since 2023." → Pulls dated milestones and predicts trends based on patterns
- **Predictive Analysis**: "What might quantum computing look like by 2030?" → Simulates futures using convergences and data, with web/X searches for real-time validation
- **Convergence Exploration**: "Find similar tech merges to drone + IoT." → Uncovers hidden links across technologies
- **Editing and Curation (Admins)**: "Add a 2025 milestone for Boston Dynamics." → Updates the knowledge base directly, keeping it current—something chatbots can't do
- **Complex Tasks**: "Plan steps to forecast battery tech scarcities turning to abundances." → Breaks down into tasks, searches external sources, and synthesizes—more structured than a single LLM response

In short, it's for deep tech foresight where you need verifiable, interconnected info over casual chit-chat.

#       1. **Trends** — He identifies exponential curves, inflection points,
#          and acceleration patterns. Capture as Trend nodes with PREDICTS edges
#          to Capabilities and LOOKS_AT edges to Milestones.

#       2. **Convergences** — He spots how breakthroughs in one EmTech accelerate
#          another. Capture as Convergence nodes linked via
#          ACCELERATES / IS_ACCELERATED_BY edges.

#       3. **Ideas and assessments** — His opinions, predictions, and strategic
#          takes go into Idea nodes. Use `argument` for reasoning, `assumptions`
#          for underlying premises, `counterargument` for opposing views.

#       4. **Capabilities and Milestones** — New thresholds or newly possible
#          things. Connect Milestones to use cases (LAC) they unlock.

#       5. **Products and breakthroughs** — Specific products (PTC), companies
#          (Party), product categories (LTC) — connect to capabilities and
#          milestones they reach.

#       Credit Alex Wissner-Gross as a Party node and relate his Ideas and Trends

      For each episode, extract and capture:

      1. **Ideas** — Key arguments, predictions, and assessments presented in
         the episode. Capture as Idea nodes with `argument` for reasoning chains,
         `assumptions` for underlying premises, and `counterargument` for
         acknowledged opposing views. RELATES_TO relevant EmTechs, Capabilities,
         Trends, or other Ideas.

      2. **Trends** — Patterns, acceleration observations, or exponential curves
         discussed. Capture as Trend nodes with PREDICTS edges to Capabilities
         and LOOKS_AT edges to Milestones.

      3. **Convergences** — When the episode discusses one EmTech accelerating
         another. Capture as Convergence with ACCELERATES / IS_ACCELERATED_BY.

      4. **Capabilities and Milestones** — New thresholds, benchmarks, or
         achievements discussed. Capture with dates when mentioned.
         Link Milestones to use cases (LAC) they UNLOCK.

      5. **Products (PTC) and Parties** — Specific products, companies, or
         people mentioned. Connect via appropriate relationships.

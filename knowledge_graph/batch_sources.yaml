      This site curates the most important AI developments of the day.

      Focus on extracting non-obvious insights, trends, and relationships that can inform deeper questions about AI progress. Prioritize:

      1. **Capabilities and Milestones** — New benchmarks, expansions, or improvements that cross thresholds, unlocking novel use cases. Capture as Capability + Milestone nodes only if they represent significant shifts (e.g., enabling previously impossible applications). Link Milestones to use cases they UNLOCK, but avoid routine metrics.

      2. **Trends** — Emerging patterns across developments (e.g., convergence of open-source with enterprise adoption). Capture as Trend nodes with PREDICTS and LOOKS_AT edges to highlight predictive value for future capabilities.

      3. **Ideas** — Notable predictions, opinions, or strategic implications. Capture as Idea nodes with `argument` and `assumptions` to preserve reasoning for re-evaluation.

      4. **Convergences** — Instances where AI intersects with other EmTechs (e.g., AI accelerating robotics). Capture as Convergence nodes with ACCELERATES / IS_ACCELERATED_BY edges.

      Do not capture every product detail or routine update—only those tied to milestones or trends that suggest new questions (e.g., "What use cases does this unlock?"). If nothing sparks new context or questions, say 'Nothing noteworthy today.'

    prompt: >
      Scan recent posts from key technology thought leaders for high-signal ideas, predictions, and strategic insights that challenge assumptions or reveal unseen connections in emerging technologies.

      Prioritize non-obvious, question-provoking content:

      1. **Ideas** — Predictions, warnings, or assessments that prompt re-thinking (e.g., AGI timelines). Capture as Idea nodes with `argument`, `assumptions`, and `counterargument`. RELATES_TO relevant EmTechs, Capabilities, Trends, or other Ideas to build contextual links.

      2. **Trends** — Observations of patterns or accelerations that suggest future milestones. Capture as Trend nodes with PREDICTS to Capabilities and LOOKS_AT to Milestones.

      3. **Convergences** — Spotted intersections where one EmTech boosts another. Capture as Convergence with ACCELERATES / IS_ACCELERATED_BY edges.

      4. **Milestones** — Highlighted achievements that unlock new thinking. Capture only if they tie to broader implications, linking to Capabilities and use cases UNLOCKED.

      Credit leaders as Party nodes and relate content to them. Ignore routine commentary; focus on insights that enable better questions (e.g., "How does this change our bets?"). If nothing noteworthy, say 'Nothing noteworthy today.'

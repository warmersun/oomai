      Query the knowledge graph for capabilities and milestones related to {user_input}. 
      Look at milestones over time. Look at new capabilities emerging and the use cases they unlock. 
      Identify the trend and capture it in the knowledge graph.
      Trends are explanations of what we observe.
      Checklist for Validating Explanations:
      - **Hard to Vary (Core Criterion)**: Is the explanation tightly constrained by the problem it addresses? Can you easily alter details (e.g., swap gods in a myth or arbitrary parameters) without changing its predictions or fit? Good explanations resist such variations; bad ones allow many equivalent variants.
      - **Explanatory Depth**: Does it explain *why* things are as they are in reality, beyond mere predictions or descriptions? It should address underlying mechanisms, not just patterns or "what happens." Avoids being a rule of thumb or prediction without interpretation.
      - **Testability and Falsifiability**: Does it make specific, risky predictions that could be refuted by observation or experiment? Mere compatibility with data isn't enough; it must be refutable in principle.
      - **Avoids Induction and Empiricism Flaws**: Does it rely on "deriving" from repeated experiences or assuming the future resembles the past without explanation? Good explanations are conjectural, not induced; they use experience to test, not source, ideas.
      - **Fallibilism and Criticism**: Acknowledges potential flaws and invites criticism? It shouldn't claim certainty or justification from authority; knowledge is tentative and improvable.
      - **Objective Reality Focus**: Describes what is *really* out there (e.g., stars as nuclear furnaces, not just dots in the sky)? Rejects instrumentalism (explanations as mere tools for prediction) and relativism (no objective truth).
      - **No Parochialism or Anthropocentrism**: Avoids narrow, human-centered assumptions (e.g., the universe is tuned for us) without broader explanatory power. Considers cosmic-scale reach and universality.
      - **Logical Consistency and No Fallacies**: Free from fallacies like justificationism (seeking authority for truth), relativism (truth is subjective), or bad philosophy (e.g., supernatural appeals without testability)?
      - **Reach and Universality**: Does it have broad implications or apply universally? Good explanations often jump to universality, explaining more than intended without ad-hoc adjustments.
      - **Creativity and Progress Potential**: Originates from conjecture and criticism? Contributes to unbounded knowledge growth, not stagnation?
      If you spot an exponential trend then use the `visualize_oom` tool to show when we can expect the next orders of magnitude in development.

      - for those milestones what were similar applications (LAC, PAC), use cases (LAC)?
      - with what  products (PTC), in what what product categories (LTC) were these milestones reached?
      - what next milestones do the trends predict?
      
      Then, structure your response:
      1. What are the treds that we are observing? Contrast the observations with the predictions, give credits to the parties that have made the predictions.
      2. Evaluate if the spotted trends are in line with the ideas, predictions.

      Act like an AI strategy consultant from a leading global consulting firm, specializing in emerging technologies and digital transformation.  
      Your task is to develop a comprehensive AI strategy recommendation for a company based on its website. The input parameter is the company's website URL: {user_input}.

      Step-by-step instructions:

      1. **Analyze the Company Website:**
        - Use your browsing capabilities (e.g., browse_page tool) to thoroughly read and summarize the content of the website at {user_input}.
        - Extract key details: company name, industry/sector, core products/services, target markets, current challenges (if mentioned), existing technology stack (especially any AI or digital initiatives), mission/vision, leadership team, recent news or blog posts, and any financial or performance metrics available.
        - Identify opportunities where AI could enhance operations, products, customer experience, or innovation.

      2. **Leverage the Knowledge Graph:**
        - Query the knowledge graph using the schema to identify relevant EmTechs (e.g., Artificial Intelligence, Robots), Capabilities (e.g., natural language processing), Milestones (e.g., achieving real-time personalization), LTCs/PTCs (e.g., Large Language Models like Grok-4), LACs/PACs (e.g., chatbots for customer service), Trends (e.g., accelerating AI adoption), Ideas, and Parties (e.g., competitors or partners).
        - Map the company's profile to the graph: For example, if the company is in healthcare, connect to EmTechs like Synthetic Biology or AI, and explore ENABLES edges to Capabilities, HAS_MILESTONE to track progress, and USES edges for potential integrations.
        - Use semantic searches on the graph's vector indices (e.g., for Convergence, Capability, etc.) to find similar patterns or predictions via PREDICTS or LOOKS_AT edges.

      3. **Conduct External Research:**
        - Use Perplexity for in-depth web searches on the company, its competitors, industry trends, and AI best practices.
        - Use LiveSearch on web and X for real-time insights: Search for recent mentions of the company (e.g., using x_keyword_search with query like "company_name AI strategy" filter:news since:YYYY-MM-DD), sentiment analysis from posts, or emerging trends (e.g., x_semantic_search with query "AI applications in [industry]").
        - Cross-reference with knowledge graph to validate or expand findings, e.g., if a Trend predicts a Milestone in AI, assess if the company has REACHES it.

      4. **Construct the AI Strategy Recommendation:**
        - Frame the response as a professional consulting report, emulating the style of firms like McKinsey, BCG, or Deloitte: Use formal language, data-driven insights, strategic frameworks (e.g., SWOT analysis, value chain mapping), and actionable recommendations.
        - Ensure recommendations are tailored, feasible, and aligned with emerging tech convergences from the knowledge graph.
        - Prioritize ethical AI, scalability, and ROI potential.

      Output Structure:
      The response must follow this exact structure. Use markdown for formatting, including headings, bullet points, tables, and bold/italics for emphasis. Do not add extra sections.

      # [Company Name] AI Strategy Recommendation

      ## Executive Summary
      - Provide a 200-300 word overview: Summarize the company's current state, key AI opportunities, high-level recommendations, and expected impact (e.g., revenue growth, efficiency gains).
      - Highlight 3-5 strategic imperatives drawn from analysis.

      ## Company Overview

      ## AI Opportunity Assessment
      - **Industry Context:** Discuss relevant trends from knowledge graph (e.g., via Trends and Predictions) and external searches.
      - **Capability Mapping:** Link company needs to graph Capabilities and Milestones. Use a table:
        | Capability | Current Status | Recommended Milestone | Unlocked Applications |
        |------------|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
        | [e.g., Predictive Analytics] | [Description] | [Milestone with date if applicable] | [LACs unlocked] |
      - **Convergence Insights:** Explain how EmTechs accelerate each other (e.g., AI + IoT for the company).

      ## Recommended AI Strategy
      - **Vision and Objectives:** State a clear AI vision aligned with company mission.
      - **Key Initiatives:** Detail 4-6 prioritized recommendations, each with:
        - Description
        - Required Components (e.g., LTCs/PTCs like LLMs, using USES edges)
        - Implementation Roadmap (phased: Short-term 0-6 months, Medium 6-18, Long 18+)
        - Metrics for Success (e.g., KPIs)
        - Potential Partners (from Parties in graph or searches)
      - **Risks and Mitigation:** Bullet list of ethical, technical, regulatory risks.

      ## Implementation Framework
      - **Governance and Organization:** Advise on AI teams, ethics boards.
      - **Technology Stack:** Recommend integrations (e.g., PACs built on PTCs).
      - **Budget and ROI Estimate:** High-level projections based on trends.

      ## Conclusion
      - Reiterate value proposition and call to action.

      ## Appendix: Sources and Assumptions
      - List key sources: Website sections browsed, knowledge graph queries (e.g., specific nodes/edges), search queries/results.
      - Note any assumptions or data limitations.

      Ensure the response is insightful, balanced, and approximately 1500-2500 words. Use tools only as needed during generation; do not mention tools in the output.

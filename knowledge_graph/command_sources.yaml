    modes: [edit, readonly]
    template: |
      Query the knowledge graph for capabilities and milestones related to {user_input}. 
      Look at milestones over time. Look at new capabilities emerging and the use cases they unlock. 
      Identify the trend and capture it in the knowledge graph.
      Trends are explanations of what we observe.
      Checklist for Validating Explanations:
      - **Hard to Vary (Core Criterion)**: Is the explanation tightly constrained by the problem it addresses? Can you easily alter details (e.g., swap gods in a myth or arbitrary parameters) without changing its predictions or fit? Good explanations resist such variations; bad ones allow many equivalent variants.
      - **Explanatory Depth**: Does it explain *why* things are as they are in reality, beyond mere predictions or descriptions? It should address underlying mechanisms, not just patterns or "what happens." Avoids being a rule of thumb or prediction without interpretation.
      - **Testability and Falsifiability**: Does it make specific, risky predictions that could be refuted by observation or experiment? Mere compatibility with data isn't enough; it must be refutable in principle.
      - **Avoids Induction and Empiricism Flaws**: Does it rely on "deriving" from repeated experiences or assuming the future resembles the past without explanation? Good explanations are conjectural, not induced; they use experience to test, not source, ideas.
      - **Fallibilism and Criticism**: Acknowledges potential flaws and invites criticism? It shouldn't claim certainty or justification from authority; knowledge is tentative and improvable.
      - **Objective Reality Focus**: Describes what is *really* out there (e.g., stars as nuclear furnaces, not just dots in the sky)? Rejects instrumentalism (explanations as mere tools for prediction) and relativism (no objective truth).
      - **No Parochialism or Anthropocentrism**: Avoids narrow, human-centered assumptions (e.g., the universe is tuned for us) without broader explanatory power. Considers cosmic-scale reach and universality.
      - **Logical Consistency and No Fallacies**: Free from fallacies like justificationism (seeking authority for truth), relativism (truth is subjective), or bad philosophy (e.g., supernatural appeals without testability)?
      - **Reach and Universality**: Does it have broad implications or apply universally? Good explanations often jump to universality, explaining more than intended without ad-hoc adjustments.
      - **Creativity and Progress Potential**: Originates from conjecture and criticism? Contributes to unbounded knowledge growth, not stagnation?

      Search the knowledge graph for an idea or trend related to the following:
      {user_input}
      Check if the prediction is valid.
      Look for related capabilities, use cases, milestones, use cases (LAC), products (PTC), implementations, solutions (PAC).
